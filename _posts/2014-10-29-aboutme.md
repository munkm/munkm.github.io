I'm Madicken Munk, a post-doctoral scholar at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
My position is in the [Data Exploration Lab](http://dxl.ncsa.illinois.edu) 
in the [National Center for Supercomputing
Applications](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/). I'm a nuclear engineer by
training, but my research interests extend beyond my domain expertise. 
Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my work, 
research interests, or potential collaboration.  

**My Work:**

I recently completed my PhD in Nuclear Engineering frrom the University of
California, Berkeley, where I was a part of the [Slaybaugh Lab](https://github.com/SlaybaughLab)
subgroup of the [Berkeley Neutronics Group](http://neutronics.nuc.berkeley.edu/). 
I am interested in a variety of applications of nuclear science and engineering, 
and have worked on [research projects](/posts/2017/09/29/projects.html) in 
several different topical areas of nuclear engineering. 
At present, I am interested in developing and contributing to 
open-source tools for nuclear
engineering and other domains. Within nuclear engineering I am interested in 
hybrid deterministic and Monte Carlo methods, radiation transport, and reactor
physics. 

**My Education:** 

* Oregon State University: BS, Nuclear Engineering [2007-2011] 
* University of California - Berkeley: MS, Nuclear Engineering [2011-2013] 
* University of California - Berkeley: PhD, Nuclear Engineering [2013-2017]
