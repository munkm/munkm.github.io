## About Me: 
 
I am Madicken Munk, a PhD Student at the University of California-Berkeley. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my past or present work.  

**My Work:**

Currently I am employed as a Graduate Student Researcher at UCB. I am interested in a variety of applications of nuclear science, and have worked on [Research Projects](/posts/2014/10/18/projects.html) in several different topical areas of nuclear engineering. At present, I am interested in hybrid deterministic and monte carlo methods. 

**My Education:** 

I attended Oregon State University from 2007 to 2011 for my undergraduate studies, where I majored in Nuclear Engineering. I worked with Dr. Steve Reese and Dr. Todd Palmer on designing a device optimized for the production of 99Mo in small, thermal reactors. 

I am currently at the University of California - Berkeley for my graduate studies. I earned a Master's of Science in Nuclear Engineering in 2013 by implementing a method to evaluate the lifetime of structural components in a Pebble-Bed Fluoride Salt-Cooled High Temperature Reactor (PB-FHR). This work was overseen by two advisors: Professors Per Peterson and Ehud Greenspan. My PhD work involves developing an algorithm for global solutions using monte carlo accelerated by determinsitic transport in problems where there is strong angular anisotropy. I am performing this work under the academic mentorship of Prof. Rachel Slaybaugh and the Exnihilo development team at ORNL. 

**My Interests:**
 
Outside of nuclear engineering, I have many pastimes. I am an avid reader of fiction. I am part of a muay thai kicboxing gym. Although newer to the activity, I particularly enjoy backpacking. I also am fond of cats and cat videos.
