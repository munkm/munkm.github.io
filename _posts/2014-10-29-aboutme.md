## About Me
 I am Madicken Munk, a Graduate Student at the University of California-Berkeley. 

**My Work**
 Currently I am employed as a Graduate Student Researcher at UCB. I am interested in a variety of applications of nuclear science, and have worked on [Research Projects](/posts/2014/10/18/projects.html) in several different topical areas of nuclear engineering. At present, I am interested in hybrid monte carlo methods. 

**My Education** 
 I attended Oregon State University from 2007 to 2011 for my undergraduate studies, where I majored in Nuclear Engineering. I worked with Dr. Steve Reese and Dr. Todd Palmer on designing a device optimized for the production of 99Mo in small, thermal reactors. 

I am currently at the University of California - Berkeley for my graduate studies. I earned a Master's of Science in Nuclear Engineering in 2013 by implementing a method to evaluate the lifetime of structural components in a Pebble-Bed Fluoride Salt-Cooled High Temperature Reactor (PB-FHR). My PhD work will be developing a hybrid monte carlo algorithm for global solutions where there is strong angular anisotropy. 

**My Interests**
 Outside of nuclear engineering, I have many pastimes. I am an avid reader of fiction. I am part of a muay thai kicboxing gym, and really enjoy the art and finesse involved in the martial arts. If I have time, I like backpacking in the mountains of California, or hiking the coastline. I also am fond of cats and cat videos.
