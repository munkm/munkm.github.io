## About Me

I am Madicken Munk, a Graduate Student at the University of California-Berkeley. 

**My Work**
Currently I am employed as a Graduate Student Researcher at UCB. I am interested in a variety of applications of nuclear science, and have worked on [Research Projects](/posts/2014/10/18/projects.html) in several different topical areas of nuclear engineering. At present, I am interested in hybrid monte carlo methods. 

**My Interests**
Outside of nuclear engineering, I have many pastimes. I am an avid reader of fiction. I am part of a muay thai kicboxing gym, and really enjoy the art and finesse involved in the martial arts. If I have time, I like backpacking in the mountains of California, or hiking the coastline. I also am fond of cats and cat videos.
