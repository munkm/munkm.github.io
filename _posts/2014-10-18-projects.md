## Past/Present and Future Areas of Research Interest:

My research interests span several sub-disciplines within nuclear
engineering and extends beyond the nuclear engineering domain. Broadly, I am
interested in developing open-source tools for nuclear engineers and scientists
that contribute to reproducible and transparent scientific practices. 

While by no means comprehensive, I am interested in the following topics: 

* Computational methods for neutron transport 
* High performance computing
* Applications of nuclear physics
* Coupled neutronic/thermal-hydraulic and neutronic/nuclear material multiphysics
* Advanced reactor core design 

## Hybrid Methods in Neutron Transport

The bulk of my dissertation work was in the realm of hybrid methods for neutron transport. 
In particular, I implemented a hybrid method analogous to CADIS and FW-CADIS that is used 
to generate variance reduction parameters for problems with deeply-penetrating radiation that also 
consisted of regions with strong angular anisotropies in the neutron flux. 
CADIS and FW-CADIS have been successful at accelerating Monte Carlo solutions for 
deep-penetration local- and global- radiation transport, but they struggle with strong 
localized angular flux gradients. 
My method incorporated more information from the flux anisotropy into the 
variance reduction parameters, more effectively capturing this type of phenomena.

## Mars Rover Neutron Source

39Ar/40Ar geochronology is a widely used technique to datermine the age and history of geological 
samples. 
This method is well suited to old samples with complex thermal histories.
However, this technique requires a fast neutron source to initiate the 39K(n,p)39Ar reaction. 
My work on this project was to design a low-mass, high-flux, fast-flux neutron source to 
send on future rover missions designed specifically for 39Ar/40Ar geochronology. 
My collaborators and I determined that it was feasible to design a neutron source for this 
purpose, but shielding the rover and terrestrial body from the source would be the 
biggest obstacle in designing a mass-feasible device.

## PB-FHR Central Reflector

The bulk of my Master's work was focused on determining the lifetime of a large reactor 
component in a pebble bed, fluoride salt-cooled, high temperature reactor. The technology 
relevant to this  reactor is currently being investigated  by an 
Integrated Research Project (IRP) between MIT, the University of Wisconsin, Madison, 
and UC Berkeley. 
UC Berkeley has been spearheading the core design for this reactor; at the time of this writing 
the current 
design was the PB-FHR MK-1. The core configuration of this design is comprised of
fueled pebbles are in an annulus 
around a graphite central reflector. The central reflector provides 
moderation for the neutrons, a more distributed burnup of core pebbles, and also 
provides flowpaths for crossflow of the coolant in the core.   

The earliest designs of the MK-1 had the central reflector constructed of a solid block of graphite. 
Given that this component is essentially in the center of the core, it will see extremely high
temperatures and fluences. Furthermore, the effective moderation of the central reflector will 
lead to strong fluence gradients in both the axial and radial directions of the reflector. This 
will lead to enormous stress buildups due to radiation-induced swelling in the graphite. 

My analysis concluded that without redesign, the central reflector will require replacement
frequencies that render the Mk-1 design unfeasible. The analysis was performed using MCNP5 
and COMSOL multiphysics.

## PB-FHR Test Reactor

In addition to designing the core for a commercial PB-FHR, the FHR-IRP has been 
investigating a test reactor that mirrors the physics of the large, commercial-scale 
PB-FHR. For this project I attempted to design a 20 MWth, 1m3 test reactor 
FHR that had the same reactivity coefficients and neutron energy spectrum as 
the commercial core. I determined that while it was possible to get close to the 
same neutron energy spectrum to the PB-FHR, it was very difficult to match 
reactivity coefficients between both cores.

## 99-Mo production

As an undergraduate student I worked on a research project with the 
objective to produce 99-Mo in 
small, low power, light water research reactors. In support of this initiative, 
I performed parametric studies to maximize the 99-Mo 
produced in a novel target design. Our work
on this resulted in a [patent](https://www.google.com/patents/US20120027152), 
and the technology has continued development at [an OSU
startup](http://terra.oregonstate.edu/2014/05/oregon-state-nuclear-engineers-solve-looming-medical-isotope-shortage/).
