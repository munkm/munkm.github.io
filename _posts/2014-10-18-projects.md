## Hybrid Methods in Neutron Transport

Is my current research area of interest.  

## Mars Rover Neutron Source

The Mars rover neutron source can be designed to adequately provide enough neutrons for 39Ar/40Ar geochronology. 

## PB-FHR Central Reflector

The bulk of my Master's work was focused on determining the lifetime of a large reactor component in a pebble bed, fluoride salt-cooled, high temperature reactor. The technology relevant to this  reactor is currently being investigated  by an Integrated Research Project (IRP) between MIT, University of Wisconsin, Madison, and UC Berkeley. UC Berkeley has been spearheading the core design for this reactor; the current design is the PB-FHR MK-1. In this design, the fueled pebbles are in an annular configuration around a graphite central reflector. The central reflector provides moderation for the neutrons, but also provides flowpaths for crossflow of the coolant in the core.   

The earliest designs of the MK-1 had the central reflector constructed of a solid block of graphite. Given that this component is essentially in the center of the core, it will see extremely high temperatures and fluences. Furthermore, the effective moderation of the central reflector will lead to strong fluence gradients in both the axial and radial directions of the reflector. This will lead to enormous stress buildups due to radiation-induced swelling in the graphite. 

My analysis concluded that without redesign, the central reflector will require replacement frequencies that render the Mk-1 design unfeasible. The analysis was performed using MCNP5 and COMSOL multiphysics.

## PB-FHR Test Reactor

Designing the test reactor to match physics of the commercial PB-FHR design is exceedingly difficult. 

## 99-Mo production

The production of 99-Mo in small, light water reactors is possible.
